We highlight an overlooked feature of renewable energy — non-diversifiable supply risk — and show that an economy with no conventional installed capacity cannot avoid occasional blackouts by increasing its renewable capacity, nor through bilateral trade with similar neighbors. We develop a model of international trade in electricity with endogeneous base-load capacity and heterogeneous beliefs about the covariance structure of the error term. We derive necessary conditions for symmetric and asymmetric equilibria to exist. A surprising result is that an optimistic country, i.e. one that believes the errors are less correlated, would choose a higher base-load capacity in expectation of more trade than the counterpart.","tags":null,"title":"Strategic interactions along the energy transition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roma Poberejsky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"a09cf01591b4816693a9ba290d970678","permalink":"https://rpober.github.io/publication/jmp_directors/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jmp_directors/","section":"publication","summary":"Holding concurrent seats on boards of rival firms, 'horizontal directors' dampen competition and improve firm performance.

I find substantial differences between the four largest firms and the rest, both in price levels and in response patterns to competitive pressure, implying that the presence of small competitors particularly contributes to lower retail prices. The study calls for pro-competitive action by regulators such as lowering the barriers to entry faced by small firms, encouraging the opening of new stations, and setting uniform policies dealing with vertical contracts.

I provide ex ante theoretical predictions regarding post-merger price increase on the scale of 2%-4% for the merging firms, with practically no effect for competitors.

Using data on Israeli corporate bonds and US defaulters, I suggest the possible risk undervaluation by Israeli credit rating agencies to be of up to 6.12 unaccounted-for rating notches, while yield spreads and other financial indicators alert of a possible default well in advance. Acknowledging that rating agencies are unable to instantaneously reflect new financial information and tend to lag behind the market, my results indicate that Israeli rating agencies provide ratings that are of significantly lower quality than their foreign counterparts. From a series of panel VAR analyses it appears that ratings in Israel are inconsistent with financial indicators, and when adjusted, provide little information to the credit market and often do not affect prices.","tags":null,"title":"The quality of corporate credit rating: evidence from Israel, 2005-2013","type":"publication"}]
